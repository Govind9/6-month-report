This is the first interface that is shown to the user. This is the Home page.
It brings a nice UI to get input from user about the Number of storeys and 
some factor affecting the structure. It also provides the user some 
additional features as an aid like uploading data as CSV files and Email 
after completion. There is an additional help icon near every field to get 
an idea of what it is. There is a static navigation bar that provides an 
Autofill values option. By clicking that option, default values are 
automatically filled.
