Dynamic of structure is an open source and free cloud based software developed by students of 
TCC under guidance of Dr. HS Rai. This software is used to compute the 
Modes of in which structure can move and also force applied on each floor 
due to the viberation caused by earthquake. so, that civil enginners can
anaylise the stability of structure consisting of many storeys. The main task 
of this software is to get data as input from user and then it can compute 
the result at backend and when the result is ready it send output as email.
This software is structed keep in veiw that user of this software can be both 
a civil enginner or a simple man whose job is just to enter data to software 
in order that an enginner can anylise latter from result stability of the structure.
This software also provide the intermediate values for ennginnering student 
to deeply anaylise the  process of compution to be done in order to get output values.
